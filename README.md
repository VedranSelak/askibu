# askIBU

askIBU is a RESTful web application that I developed for students of the International Burch University to ask eachother questions. Each student can make an account and ask or answers questions.

The web app is hosted using DigitalOcean. You can acces the web app [here](https://askibu.selak.me).


#Notice
 If the SMTP mailing service doesn't work it is because the Captcha is no unlocked on the gmail account that is used to send emails!!
 
 In that case use these two accounts to take a look at the web app:
 1. Email: vedran.selak@stu.ibu.edu.ba; Password: password123; (User access)
 2. Email: selakvedran@gmail.com; Password: admin123; (Admin access)
