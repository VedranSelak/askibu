# askIBU

askIBU is a RESTful web application that I developed for students of the International Burch University to ask each other questions. Each student can make an account and ask or answers questions.

The web app is hosted using DigitalOcean. You can acces the web app *[here](https://askibu.selak.me)*.


## *Notice*
 If the SMTP mailing service doesn't work it is because the Captcha is not unlocked on the gmail account that is used to send emails!!
 
 In that case use these two accounts to take a look at the web app:
 * Email: *vedran.selak@stu.ibu.edu.ba*; Password: *password123*; (User access)
 * Email: *selakvedran@gmail.com*; Password: *admin123*; (Admin access)
